## 00 – Seed notes from the initial review – 2026-10-28

**Summary**: Notes from a manual review before the runbook started. Prompt 01 must verify each one and
turn it into an `AUDIT.md` item.

**Known defects**:

- `content/docs/examples/dashboard.mdx` has 13 broken links. They use the `/docs/...` base, which is
  the developer docs, and point to pages that don't exist.
- Widgets with no docs page: `ActivityFeed`, `EntityList`, `QuickActions`, `WelcomeBanner` and
  `ActionList`. `Notifications` is documented as `notification-bell`. Check the naming.
- The component table on `content/docs/index.mdx` is stale. It's missing the widgets, the charts and
  the components added on 2026-10-28.
- `conventions.mdx`:
  - The list of components with `classNames` is stale.
  - The `render` prop is explained twice.
  - Customisation and Styling overlap.
  - It refers to an internal repo path (`packages/ui/tailwind/theme.css`).
  - It promises a changelog with migration notes, and none exists.
- The `Meter` TSDoc and docs example `value={72} format={{ style: 'percent' }}` renders "7,200%".
- `charts/*.mdx` don't follow the page template: no `icon`, `status` or `summary`, and a different
  tone ("**Important Version Guidance:**").
- The site shows `v0.0.1` while `conventions.mdx` promises semantic-versioning guarantees.
- Only 46 of 78 pages have an Accessibility section. Most component pages are 20–45 lines. Only Button
  has a props playground.
- Spelling is mixed (colour/color, customise/Customization, behaviour/behavior).
- Heading case is mixed (Title Case and sentence case).
- There is no changelog, migration guide, deprecation policy, support matrix (React versions,
  browsers), accessibility statement, security page, or patterns or guides section.
- The tokens table on `theming.mdx` is hand-written. It doesn't show dark values and can drift from
  `tailwind/theme.css`.
- There's no "Edit this page" link, no "Last updated", no `llms.txt`, and no status legend.

**Added on 2026-10-28 (Beta, not yet checked in a browser)**: `TagInput`, `FileDropzone`,
`TreeView`, `SplitPane`, `Gauge`, `KanbanBoard`, `PermissionMatrix`, `ChangeLog`, and `RichTextEditor`
(in `@innostes/ui/editor`). Known limit: `KanbanBoard`'s mouse dragging uses native HTML drag and
drop, which doesn't work on touch screens.
